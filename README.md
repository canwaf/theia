# Theia is a CSV-W visualiser

Theia is a CSV-W visualiser that allows you to visualise CSV-W files in a tabular format. Theia is a web application that is built atop Tabulator's open-source library and simple JavaScript to look up key-value pairs to return the data's metadata in a human-friendly way.

Currently, Theia's pages are fully dynamic besides a single static variable pointing to the CSV-W's JSON file. This means that the HTML page is entirely blank with JavaScript. This is temporary, as the metadata and data preview could be generated as part of a simple GitHub action to create a static page which end-users without JavaScript can view.

## How to use Theia

To use Theia, you need to have a CSV-W file built using [csvcubed](gss-cogs.github.io/csvcubed). The CSV-W file should be hosted on a server, and the URL of its JSON file should be provided to Theia using the JavaScript variable `METADATA_JSON`. Theia will then fetch the CSV-W file and display the data in a tabular format in addition to its metadata.

## Architecture

Theia primarily depends on Tabulator, a JavaScript library that allows you to create tables. Theia passes the CSV file location to Tabulator, which then fetches the data and displays it in a table. Theia also fetches the metadata from the CSV-W file and displays it in a human-readable format.

## Future work

Theia is currently a proof of concept, and there are many improvements that can be made to it. Some of the improvements that can be made are:

- **Static page generation**: Theia can be improved by generating a static page using GitHub actions. This will allow users without JavaScript to view a preview of the tabular data and metadata. This can be done by using GitHub Actions or Flask.
- **Improved metadata display**: Theia can be improved by displaying the metadata in a more human-readable format (e.g. not using URLs for the pulisher).
- **Improved tabular data display**: Theia can be made more CSV-W aware by suppressing the display of columns which are part of the CSV but excluded in the CSV-W.
